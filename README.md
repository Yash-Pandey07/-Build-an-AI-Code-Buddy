# Gemini API Node.js Quickstart - README

## Overview

Welcome to the Gemini API Node.js Quickstart! This guide empowers you to seamlessly integrate the Gemini API into your Node.js application using the Google AI JavaScript SDK. Dive into the following steps to kickstart your project, generate captivating text, and delve into a world of versatile use cases.

## Prerequisites

Ensure your development environment boasts the following prerequisites:

- Node.js v18+
- npm

## Set Up Your Project

1. **API Key**: Acquire an API key from Google AI Studio. If you lack one, craft your key using the guidance in the "Get an API Key" section.

2. **Secure Your API Key**: Safeguard your API key by avoiding version control inclusion. Utilize a secrets store for enhanced security.

3. **Install SDK Package**: Effortlessly install the GoogleGenerativeAI package for Node.js with the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install @google/generative-ai
   ```

4. **Initialize the Generative Model**: Inject life into your project by importing and initializing the Generative Model. Specify a model tailored to your use case.

   ```javascript
   const { GoogleGenerativeAI } = require("@google/generative-ai");

   // Access your API key as an environment variable
   const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.API_KEY);

   const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "MODEL_NAME" });
   ```

## Implement Captivating Use Cases

Embark on an exploration of diverse use cases with the Gemini API:

1. **Generate Text from Text-Only Input**:

   ```javascript
   const prompt = "Write a captivating story about a magical backpack.";

   const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);
   const response = await result.response;
   const text = response.text();
   console.log(text);
   ```

2. **Generate Text from Text-and-Image Input (Multimodal)**:

   ```javascript
   const prompt = "Uncover the differences between these intriguing pictures.";

   const imageParts = [
     fileToGenerativePart("image1.png", "image/png"),
     fileToGenerativePart("image2.jpeg", "image/jpeg"),
   ];

   const result = await model.generateContent([prompt, ...imageParts]);
   const response = await result.response;
   const text = response.text();
   console.log(text);
   ```

3. **Build Engaging Multi-Turn Conversations (Chat)**:

   ```javascript
   const chat = model.startChat({
     history: [
       { role: "user", parts: "Hello, I share my home with 2 delightful dogs." },
       { role: "model", parts: "Fantastic! What would you like to know?" },
     ],
     generationConfig: {
       maxOutputTokens: 100,
     },
   });

   const msg = "How many paws grace my humble abode?";
   ```

## Advanced Use Cases and Options

Explore advanced use cases such as embeddings, token counting, and fine-tune content generation. Refer to the official Gemini API documentation for more details.
